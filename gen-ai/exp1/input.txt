Cons
Generating synthetic data effectively requires a well-trained model, which typically needs a substantial amount of high-quality data. This creates a paradox when dealing with limited data: you need good data to create a model that can generate more data. So using GANS to generate synthetic data may not be a great idea to train the models. 
Key Points:
1. Data Quality: High-quality, diverse datasets are essential for training robust generative models.
2. Initial Data Requirements: Generative models, such as GANs, need a significant amount of initial real data to learn the underlying distributions accurately.
3. Bias and Reliability: Using synthetic data generated from a model trained on limited data can introduce biases and reduce reliability.
4. Complementary Use: While synthetic data can augment real data, it should not replace real data entirely. It’s best used to complement and enhance datasets, especially for underrepresented classes or scenarios.
